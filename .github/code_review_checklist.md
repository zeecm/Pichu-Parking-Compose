# Kotlin Code Review Checklist

This checklist is designed to help you review Kotlin code to ensure readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Use this checklist as a guideline during code reviews.

## General Guidelines

- [ ] Does the code follow the project's coding style and naming conventions?
- [ ] Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?
- [ ] Are there any commented-out code blocks or TODO comments that need attention?
- [ ] Is the code modular and organized into appropriate packages and classes?
- [ ] Are code comments used to explain complex logic or algorithms when necessary?

## Kotlin Language Features

- [ ] Are Kotlin features like data classes, sealed classes, and extension functions used appropriately?
- [ ] Are nullable types (`Type?`) used when necessary, and are null safety practices followed?
- [ ] Are `val` and `var` used appropriately to indicate immutability or mutability of variables?
- [ ] Are `when` expressions used effectively instead of long chains of `if` and `else if` statements?
- [ ] Are lambda expressions and higher-order functions used where appropriate to simplify code?

## Error Handling

- [ ] Are exceptions used for exceptional cases only, and not for control flow?
- [ ] Are try-catch blocks used to handle exceptions gracefully when necessary?
- [ ] Is logging or proper error reporting included in exception handling?

## Functional Programming

- [ ] Is the code leveraging functional programming concepts like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `fold` when appropriate?
- [ ] Are collections and sequences used effectively to process data?
- [ ] Are immutable collections used to prevent unintended modifications?

## Performance and Optimization

- [ ] Are expensive operations, such as I/O or network calls, performed on background threads or coroutines?
- [ ] Are computationally intensive tasks optimized for efficiency?
- [ ] Are memory leaks and resource leaks avoided?

## Testing

- [ ] Are unit tests written for critical code paths and functions?
- [ ] Do tests cover edge cases and possible error scenarios?
- [ ] Are Kotlin testing libraries (e.g., JUnit, MockK) used effectively?

## Dependency Management

- [ ] Are external libraries and dependencies used sparingly and kept up to date?
- [ ] Are dependencies declared in a clear and organized manner in the project's build files (e.g., Gradle or Maven)?

## Code Formatting and Style

- [ ] Is the code formatted consistently using Kotlin coding style guidelines and automatic formatting tools?
- [ ] Are indentation, line breaks, and whitespace usage consistent and readable?
- [ ] Are imports organized and optimized to avoid unused imports?

## Security

- [ ] Are input validation and sanitation practices followed to prevent security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] Is sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) stored securely and not exposed in the codebase?
